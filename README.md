# Deep Diving into GANs: from theory to production

With our accrued experience with GANs, we would like to guide you through the required steps to go from theory to production with this revolutionary technology.

Starting from the very basic of what a GAN is, passing trough TensorFlow implementation, using the most cutting edge APIs available in the framework, and finally, production-ready serving at scale using Google Cloud Functions.

This is the [ZURU Tech](https://zuru.tech/) way of making GANs: enjoy it.

## Requirements

<!--
TODO: remove the comment when colab will support Python 3.7
**NOTE**: every notebook has a "try in a colab notebook" button you can use, to directly load the notebook in a colab instance and run it, without the need to set up the environment by yourself.
-->

This tutorial requires the following packages:

- `python` >= 3.7
- `tensorflow` >=2.0: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
- `jupyter`
- `numpy`

## Setting up the environment (Linux, MacOS)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurutech/gans-from-theory-to-production
cd gans-from-theory-to-production
```

### Prepare a virtual environment

- `virtualenv`: `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate`

### Installing the required packages

```bash
pip install -r no-gpu-requirements.txt
# or pip install -r gpu-requirements if a GPU with Compute Capability >= 3.0 is present
```

### Start your Jupyter server

`jupyter notebook .` or the newer `jupyter lab .`.
