# Deep Diving into GANs: from theory to production

With our accrued experience with GANs, we would like to guide you through the required steps to go from theory to production with this revolutionary technology.

Starting from the very basic of what a GAN is, passing trough Tensorflow implementation, using the most cutting edge APIs available in the framework, and finally, production-ready serving at scale using Google Cloud ML Engine.

## Requirements

This tutorial requires the following packages:

- python >= 3.6
- `tensorflow` >=1.9: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux

Optional, but recommended:

- NVIDIA CUDAÂ®: Compute Unified Device Architecture
- cuDNN: The NVIDIA CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 3.0 or higher, you can install `tensorflow-gpu` instead of `tensorflow`.

- Google Cloud ML account: only needed for the production section.

### Setting up the environment

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurutech/gans-from-theory-to-production
```

**Installing Tensorflow**

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
# of pip install tensorflow if no GPU with Compute Capability >= 3.0 is present
```

If you're here, you're ready to go.
