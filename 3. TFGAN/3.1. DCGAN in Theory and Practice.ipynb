    "[1]: [The GAN Landscape: Losses, Architectures, Regularization, and Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04720v1), which in our opinion is one of the most thorough scientific studies on GANs out there, suggests that `Spectral Normalization` is the real big deal and that `BatchNorm` actually hurt performance if applied to the Discriminator. We still decided to go with the classic formulation of DCGAN as not to overtax you with theoretical discussions. We leave the implementation of the `Spectral Normalization`(and SNGAN) to you as an exercise. On the theoretical treating of `BatchNorm` we recommend a back to back reading of [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167), [Understanding Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02375v1), [How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization? (No, It Is Not About Internal Covariate Shift)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11604) \n",
    "\n",
    "[2]: While often you want to work with **features (and labels)** fetched from a `tf.Dataset`, the **noise** should always be instantiated using a simple TensorFlow node. Trying to create a noise-containing `tf.Dataset` for the `train_input_fn` is not worth the effort. NOTE: that as things are different for the [predict_input_fn](##predict_input_fn()). "
