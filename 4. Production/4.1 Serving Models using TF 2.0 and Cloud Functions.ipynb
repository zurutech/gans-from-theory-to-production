    "Upload the weights using the `gsutil` command line tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd 3.\\ AshPy\n",

    "cp generator* dcgan\n",
    "gsutil cp -r dcgan gs://euroscipy-2019-workshop/dcgan-weights\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we need to deploy our Cloud Function.\n",

    "gcloud functions deploy euroscipy-2019-tutorial --entry-point handler --stage-bucket zuru-ml-cloud-functions --runtime python37 --trigger-http --memory 2048\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- `euroscipy-2019-tutorial`: ID of the function or fully qualified identifier for the function.\n",
    "- `--entry-point handler`: Name of a Google Cloud Function (as defined in source code) that will be executed. \n",
    "- `--stage-bucket zuru-ml-cloud-functions`: When deploying a function from a local directory, this flag's value is the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket in which source code will be stored.\n",
    "- `--runtime python37`: Runtime in which to run the function.\n",
    "- `--trigger-http`: Function will be assigned an endpoint, which you can view by using the describe command.\n",
    "- `--memory 2048`: Limit on the amount of memory the function can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dashboard Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also upload the function from the [dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list?_ga=2.247640449.-709977754.1558685959)\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, push the “Create” button and initialize the creation of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the function is deployed, you can test it in the “Testing” section of the Cloud Functions dashboard.\n",
    "You can also customize incoming events and see output as well as logs.\n",
