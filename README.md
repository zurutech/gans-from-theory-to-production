# Deep Diving into GANs: from theory to production

With our accrued experience with GANs, we would like to guide you through the required steps to go from theory to production with this revolutionary technology.

Starting from the very basic of what a GAN is, passing trough Tensorflow implementation, using the most cutting edge APIs available in the framework, and finally, production-ready serving at scale using Google Cloud ML Engine.

This is the [ZURU Tech](https://zuru.tech/) way of making GANs: enjoy it.

## Requirements

This tutorial requires the following packages:

- `python` >= 3.6
- `tensorflow` >=1.9: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
- `jupyter`
- `numpy`
- `requests` to run the CelebA Dataset deownloader

### Optional, but recommended:

- `virtualenv` to manage a virtual environment
- NVIDIA CUDA®: Compute Unified Device Architecture
- cuDNN: The NVIDIA CUDA® Deep Neural Network library
- **NOTE:** If you have an NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 3.0 or higher, you can install `tensorflow-gpu` instead of `tensorflow`.
- Google Cloud account with access to the CloudML APIs (only needed for the serving in production section).
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) (only needed for the serving in production section).
- `jsonlines` to easily generate .ndjson files for CloudML Engine

## Setting up the environment (Linux, MacOS)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurutech/gans-from-theory-to-production
cd gans-from-theory-to-production
```

### Prepare a virtual environment

- `virtualenv`: `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate`

### Installing the required packages

```bash
pip install -r no-gpu-requirements.txt
# or pip install -r gpu-requirements if a GPU with Compute Capability >= 3.0 is present
```

### Prepare the CelebA Dataset

```bash
python prepare_dataset.py
```

### Start your Jupyter server

`jupyter notebook .` or the newer `jupyter lab .`.

If you're here, you're ready to go.

Happy workshop!
